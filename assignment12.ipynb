    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that learns from labeled data. Labeled data is data that has been tagged with a correct answer or classification. For example, if you have a dataset of images of fruits, each image would have a label such as “apple”, “banana”, or “orange”. Supervised learning algorithms use the labeled data to learn the relationship between the input features (such as shape, color, and texture) and the output labels (such as fruit names). Then, they can make predictions on new, unlabeled data based on what they have learned.\n",

The validation set helps to tune the model’s hyperparameters and configurations, and to prevent overfitting or underfitting. Overfitting is when the model becomes too good at fitting the training data, but fails to generalize to new data. Underfitting is when the model is too simple and cannot capture the complexity of the data.\n",

The test set should be independent and unseen by the model, and should reflect the real-world data that the model will encounter.
